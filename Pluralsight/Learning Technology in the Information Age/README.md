# Learning Technology in the Information Age

## Part 1: The world has changed - and That’s No Cliche
### Knowledge is King
> If knowledge is king, then the King is dead.

The "Cost of Information" has been decreasing, as the:
- Cost to find an answer on a website = Zero
- Cost to ask a question on a forum = Zero
- Cost to outsource a solution = Cheap

Tools are cheap (Smartphone, Laptop, Micro Controllers, Networking Kits, ... etc.). So, anyone can learn anything at a very low cost or even for FREE. That's why you must learn things that have a HIGHER value, and isn't very easy to obtain.

**Conclusion:**
Knowledge was the King, but it's no longer true. In the Information Age, it's very easy to `Google` on any topic, learn it, and implement it yourself without hiring someone.

That's why:
- Knowledge, Information and Tools ~= Free
- Skills = VERY expensive

> Now, we are a Skills-Level Society, not a Knowledge-Level Society

**Ask Yourself: How do you prove that you have skills?**


## Part 2: Learning Paths
Let's divide your journey into 4 stages:
1. Fundamentals
2. Information
3. Skills
4. Innovation

### 1. Fundamentals
Once it sinks in, it lasts forever. Fundamentals are hard to learn, but worth every minute because it's:

- **Widely Applicable;** Not bound to one particular implementation/technology stack
- **Rarely becomes obsolete;** Fundamental knowledge can last a lifetime


### 2. Information
What's the difference between the "Fundamentals" and "Information"?
- **Fundamentals:** What is an integer, and how is it used?
- **Information:** How to use & implement an integer in C#?

A solid understanding of the fundamental concepts gives you a huge advantage to learning & understanding a specific implementation of something.

**Information tends to obsolete VERY quickly;** Your knowledge of "Configuring a tool" will be changed frequently, once that tool gets updated. _(Such as what happened with me, with Gulp V3 and V4)_

> Learning the Fundamentals will help you survive, while new technologies come

### 3. Skills
Translating the `Knowledge` & `Information` into reality - Called, `Skills`!

> In a world where the value of Knowledge & Information decrease, the value of Skills increase...

- **Fundamentals:** Helps you to learn & process information
- **Information:** Specific knowledge you use to solve problems
- **Skills:** The ability to use knowledge to solve problems

If you're;
- **Beginner:** You are solving problems slowly, and your solutions may not be optimal
- **Expert:** You are solving problems quickly, and your solutions are efficient and reliable

In most cases, it’s the Skills that generate income. 
> **People pay you because you "do" things, not "know" things**


### 4. Innovation
Experts can solve problems that are solvable, and know which ones aren’t

Experts "have access" to the Fundamental Knowledge, Information and Skills that are required to do so. They don’t need to "know everything", but they "have access" to what they might need. Well, if they don’t find it, they will create it!

Experts find the best way to do things, create stuff. Basically, they do what search can’t...!

Becoming an "Expert" always come after being "Competent" in something.

### Maximizing the financial returns from the effort you put into learning technology
Being a beginner rarely pays well and the supply is high. Beginners are slow and make mistakes. The law of supply & demand comes; **Low quality with high supply, results in low wages.**

Competence pays very well and gives you the job security, Reaching a competence level of Fundaments, Information and Skills for a particular technology is the most efficient way to maximize your income.

**What about expertise?** From a financial perspective, it’s rarely the best use of your time. Think of it from the company’s perspective:

**If a beginner can do the job, why they need to hire an Expert?** Generally, if competent individuals can solve 95% of technology problems, it doesn’t make any sense for a company to hire experts at a greater price. Well, sometimes they do - For example if you’re going to fix an issue on the company’s core features, or even having an Expert just in case bad things happen!


#### Competent vs Expert
Competent:
- Study
- Search for solutions
- Practice Skills
- Good for most people

Expert:
- Experimentation
- Research
- Perseverance (It’s very hard to “stay” an expert)
- Good for authors, keynote speakers, consultants.
- Passionate about a specific technology, not a strategic choice!

> **The point is to convey that you shouldn't feel the need to go beyond competence unless there is a good reason. Once you’re competent in X, you can start becoming competent in Y, instead of becoming an X Expert!**

### The Time Value of Learning
Learning a new technology/skill isn’t about books, courses… It’s all about how much time are you going to invest in X?

Keep in mind, by deciding on learning technology X, you must understand that there is a **long-time commitment** here.
Ex.: I am trying to learn React, so it’s not only about learning it now & use it… I have to stay updated with its Eco-System for a long period of time to sustain my job opportunities!

Learning a new technology is like purchasing a new car, you compare it with others, read about its features, durability, ...etc. So, I have to DECIDE based on CHARACTERISTICS... That's why you need to do your research before learning your next technology/tool.

Think of it this way:
- Hard to learn = Long-lasting Skill (How the browser works)
- Easy to learn = Rapidly-Changed Skill (React)

In other words;
- **Fundamentals:** Very long lasting, rarely become obsolete and it’s transferrable
- **Information:** The exact opposite. Changes frequently and tends to get obsolete very quickly. Learning a technology is not a one-time investment, it’s an on-going commitment, to stay updated!
- **Skills:** Something in-between. Skills focus on Fundamentals, last long. Skills focus on Information/Technology doesn’t last long.
