# Learning Technology in the Information Age

## Part 1: The world has changed - and Thatâ€™s No Cliche
### Knowledge is King
> If knowledge is king, then the King is dead.

The "Cost of Information" has been decreasing, as the:
- Cost to find an answer on a website = Zero
- Cost to ask a question on a forum = Zero
- Cost to outsource a solution = Cheap

Tools are cheap (Smartphone, Laptop, Micro Controllers, Networking Kits, ... etc.). So, anyone can learn anything at a very low cost or even for FREE. That's why you must learn things that have a HIGHER value, and isn't very easy to obtain.

**Conclusion:**
Knowledge was the King, but it's no longer true. In the Information Age, it's very easy to `Google` on any topic, learn it, and implement it yourself without hiring someone.

That's why:
- Knowledge, Information and Tools ~= Free
- Skills = VERY expensive

> Now, we are a Skills-Level Society, not a Knowledge-Level Society

**Ask Yourself: How do you prove that you have skills?**


## Part 2: Learning Paths
Let's divide your journey into 4 stages:
1. Fundamentals
2. Information
3. Skills
4. Innovation

### 1. Fundamentals
Once it sinks in, it lasts forever. Fundamentals are hard to learn, but worth every minute because it's:

- **Widely Applicable;** Not bound to one particular implementation/technology stack
- **Rarely becomes obsolete;** Fundamental knowledge can last a lifetime


### 2. Information
What's the difference between the "Fundamentals" and "Information"?
- **Fundamentals:** What is an integer, and how is it used?
- **Information:** How to use & implement an integer in C#?

A solid understanding of the fundamental concepts gives you a huge advantage to learning & understanding a specific implementation of something.

**Information tends to obsolete VERY quickly;** Your knowledge of "Configuring a tool" will be changed frequently, once that tool gets updated. _(Such as what happened with me, with Gulp V3 and V4)_

> Learning the Fundamentals will help you survive, while new technologies come
