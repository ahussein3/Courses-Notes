# Learning Technology in the Information Age

## Part 1: The world has changed - and That’s No Cliche
### Knowledge is King
> If knowledge is king, then the King is dead.

The "Cost of Information" has been decreasing, as the:
- Cost to find an answer on a website = Zero
- Cost to ask a question on a forum = Zero
- Cost to outsource a solution = Cheap

Tools are cheap (Smartphone, Laptop, Micro Controllers, Networking Kits, ... etc.). So, anyone can learn anything at a very low cost or even for FREE. That's why you must learn things that have a HIGHER value, and isn't very easy to obtain.

**Conclusion:**
Knowledge was the King, but it's no longer true. In the Information Age, it's very easy to `Google` on any topic, learn it, and implement it yourself without hiring someone.

That's why:
- Knowledge, Information and Tools ~= Free
- Skills = VERY expensive

> Now, we are a Skills-Level Society, not a Knowledge-Level Society

**Ask Yourself: How do you prove that you have skills?**


## Part 2: Learning Paths
Let's divide your journey into 4 stages:
1. Fundamentals
2. Information
3. Skills
4. Innovation

### 1. Fundamentals
Once it sinks in, it lasts forever. Fundamentals are hard to learn, but worth every minute because it's:

- **Widely Applicable;** Not bound to one particular implementation/technology stack
- **Rarely becomes obsolete;** Fundamental knowledge can last a lifetime


### 2. Information
What's the difference between the "Fundamentals" and "Information"?
- **Fundamentals:** What is an integer, and how is it used?
- **Information:** How to use & implement an integer in C#?

A solid understanding of the fundamental concepts gives you a huge advantage to learning & understanding a specific implementation of something.

**Information tends to obsolete VERY quickly;** Your knowledge of "Configuring a tool" will be changed frequently, once that tool gets updated. _(Such as what happened with me, with Gulp V3 and V4)_

> Learning the Fundamentals will help you survive, while new technologies come

### 3. Skills
Translating the `Knowledge` & `Information` into reality - Called, `Skills`!

> In a world where the value of Knowledge & Information decrease, the value of Skills increase...

- **Fundamentals:** Helps you to learn & process information
- **Information:** Specific knowledge you use to solve problems
- **Skills:** The ability to use knowledge to solve problems

If you're;
- **Beginner:** You are solving problems slowly, and your solutions may not be optimal
- **Expert:** You are solving problems quickly, and your solutions are efficient and reliable

In most cases, it’s the Skills that generate income. 
> **People pay you because you "do" things, not "know" things**


### 4. Innovation
Experts can solve problems that are solvable, and know which ones aren’t

Experts "have access" to the Fundamental Knowledge, Information and Skills that are required to do so. They don’t need to "know everything", but they "have access" to what they might need. Well, if they don’t find it, they will create it!

Experts find the best way to do things, create stuff. Basically, they do what search can’t...!

Becoming an "Expert" always come after being "Competent" in something.

### Maximizing the financial returns from the effort you put into learning technology
Being a beginner rarely pays well and the supply is high. Beginners are slow and make mistakes. The law of supply & demand comes; **Low quality with high supply, results in low wages.**

Competence pays very well and gives you the job security, Reaching a competence level of Fundaments, Information and Skills for a particular technology is the most efficient way to maximize your income.

**What about expertise?** From a financial perspective, it’s rarely the best use of your time. Think of it from the company’s perspective:

**If a beginner can do the job, why they need to hire an Expert?** Generally, if competent individuals can solve 95% of technology problems, it doesn’t make any sense for a company to hire experts at a greater price. Well, sometimes they do - For example if you’re going to fix an issue on the company’s core features, or even having an Expert just in case bad things happen!


#### Competent vs Expert
Competent:
- Study
- Search for solutions
- Practice Skills
- Good for most people

Expert:
- Experimentation
- Research
- Perseverance (It’s very hard to "stay" an expert)
- Good for authors, keynote speakers, consultants.
- Passionate about a specific technology, not a strategic choice!

> **The point is to convey that you shouldn't feel the need to go beyond competence unless there is a good reason. Once you’re competent in X, you can start becoming competent in Y, instead of becoming an X Expert!**

### The Time Value of Learning
Learning a new technology/skill isn’t about books, courses… It’s all about how much time are you going to invest in X?

Keep in mind, by deciding on learning technology X, you must understand that there is a **long-time commitment** here.
Ex.: I am trying to learn React, so it’s not only about learning it now & use it… I have to stay updated with its Eco-System for a long period of time to sustain my job opportunities!

Learning a new technology is like purchasing a new car, you compare it with others, read about its features, durability, ...etc. So, I have to DECIDE based on CHARACTERISTICS... That's why you need to do your research before learning your next technology/tool.

Think of it this way:
- Hard to learn = Long-lasting Skill (How the browser works)
- Easy to learn = Rapidly-Changed Skill (React)

In other words;
- **Fundamentals:** Very long lasting, rarely become obsolete and it’s transferrable
- **Information:** The exact opposite. Changes frequently and tends to get obsolete very quickly. Learning a technology is not a one-time investment, it’s an on-going commitment, to stay updated!
- **Skills:** Something in-between. Skills focus on Fundamentals, last long. Skills focus on Information/Technology doesn’t last long.

### The Three Branches of Knowledge
**Soft Skills** are often ignored by Developers. In fact, it’s the rarest skills to be obsolete, on the contrary - It evolves over time. So, it worth every minute of your time!

Three Branches of Knowledge are:
- Technical
- Business & Finance
- Leadership & Management

## Part 3: Knowledge, Skills, and Practice
If you want to know something, the challenge isn’t to "Find" information, it’s to "Filter" information!

### Knowledge, Skills, and Practice
**_[Didn't understand this part]_** The "Drunken Sailor" problem is a classic example problem in Computer Science typically used to demonstrate the "Monte Carlo" method - Solving a problem through simulation.

### The Nature of Schools
Academic Professors are experts on the "Fundamentals" track, so don’t expect to get the latest technology information from them!

The school gives you:
- Fundamentals
- Information
- Skills
- Curation
- Support
- Certification
- Expertise

Basically, the schools  "ilters" the information for you…

Now… In the Information Age, you can get all the previous benefits without a school. Let’s explain the alternatives for each aspect of the previously mentioned aspects.

### Where do you go for Curation?
- Where do you start?
- Learn prerequisites
- Read books; Its content is curated by the author - In a particular order.
- First step; Order 1:2 beginners book!
- Online Courses: Put make sure to get high-standards content
- Search University Web sites for more detailed course description, and lesson plans
- Industry Certification; Tends to focus on specific topics regardless of its fundamentals

### Where do you go for Knowledge?
- Books are usually good and worth reading, it also has a great curation
- Video Courses aren’t usually good… But try to find & go for the best.
- Blogs lack curation
- Product Reference Documentation is often the "Gold Standard" for information on a technology… There are some limitations, or even so many unnecessary docs, and it might have incorrect info in the documentation, report them!
- School teachers suffer from staying up-to-date with technologies, just like you
- Hire an expert to teach you
- Attend conferences, staying updated with latest conferences


### Where do you go for Skills?
- Skills are where the real money lies
- Practice makes perfect… You can’t achieve competence without practice
- There’s no substitute for hands-on experience. And no excuse for not getting it. Following a tutorial or walkthrough isn’t enough, you HAVE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS ON YOUR OWN!
- Curiosity & Desire to win will help you create better products with fewer lines of code. Don’t limit your attention to a course curriculum.

You learn to solve problems, by solving problems. If you don’t have problems, use a website like StackOverflow and help to fix someone else’ problem… Don’t check the answers, only the question, and try to fix it on your own & implement the solution you come up with!

Also, Open Source Contributing is a great way to solve problems and highlight yourself, it’s your NEW RESUME!

### Where do you go for Support?
- Learning with others / Study Group
- Find A Mentor/Teacher
- Training at Work
- Online Community is great as well

### Where do you go for Gain Expertise?
- The more knowledge, information, and Skills you have!
- Look for questions that "don’t" have answers yet.
- Figure out how to fix an unknown problem, argue about the best way to do X

### Where do you go for Certification?
- Why you need certifications?
    - You can’t explain all your skills in your CV
    - Even if you did, the people who read it won’t understand your skills
    - It proves & defines a specific Domain Competence
    - A commitment to keep your certification valid with every release (Re-take it yearly for example)
- Who issues the certification? 
- For consultants; It helps them to get more clients & charge more (Microsoft Certifications for example)
- Certifications are less valuable when the demand is high. But are very good during down-times, when the opportunities are very low.

If your employers don’t care about it, or you’ve your own career path (startup) you mightn’t need it.

There are other types of certifications:
- Write a book
- Open-Source Project
- Accomplishments

Should you get certified or not? It depends.

Find what certifications available in your career, do employers ask for them, worth the money/time and the commitment? If so, decide & plan your path to get it, and go for it.


### Where do you go for Fun?
Take the time & Play around other technologies!

## Part 4: What do you want to learn today?
Which track do you want to focus? How far do I need to go?

Focus on the Fundamentals Track.

Ex.: What to focus on, to becoming A WordPress Developer?
- **Fundamentals:** Domain COnfiguration, DNS, Apache or IIS, URL Rewrite, HTML, JS, PHP, MySQL
- **Information:** WordPress COnfiguration, Common Plugins/Themes, Wordpress Architecture, Database, and API
- **Skills:** Bring up a site (start to finish), Create or modify WordPress Plugin

The more fundamentals you have, the faster you find a "good" solution!

> Don’t invest heavily in knowledge/skills you’ll only use once or twice...

Let’s create a Learning Plan:

### Learning Fundamentals
- What are the fundamentals for your domain? 
- How much of a beginner you’re?

Ex.: PHP/MySQL are the fundaments for WordPress (Information)

Hold on…
- Variables & Basic Programming are the fundaments for PHP/MySQL (Information)

So... **How to know the fundamentals?** Look for the curations of Universities Certificates, … etc. Make sure to choose the fundamentals that appear on - almost - all curations.

Also, Books & Online Courses are great to find curation - Just check the table of contents!

#### HOMEWORK
- Pick a domain
- Find two or three schools
- Identify available certification
- Identify courses/topics/requirements for certification
- Find several books in the domain
- Find one or more Pluralsight courses in the domain
- Identify topics that they have in common

Don’t use one course/book to seek information from, try several options!

### Acquiring Information
- Information goes obsolete very quickly
- Not a source for curation
- Filter "Google Search" results, any article older than a year should be suspected
- Buy a book, Take a class, Attend a user group, … etc. To grasp the most recent information
- You don’t need to worry about creating a detailed plan on this track (information) as you’ll often learn as you discover

### Gaining Skills
- Get the necessary equipment, Install the development platform, .. etc.
- Tutorials are good, but not enough to gain real skills. Only watch the MINIMAL tutorials to get started.
- Experiment - Playaround, A LOT
- Stay curious, and build some stuff

Here, on StackOverflow; Don’t read the answer, or answer a question, just implement the solution!

Solving problems will force you to learn more information, and - definitely - get back to some fundamental topics. Also, consider doing freelance/consultants work!

### Becoming an Expert
In most cases, it "happens to you" not something you plan
- Keep learning & stay updated
- Answer questions
- Write or Blog
- Contribute to projects
- Attend & Speak at meetups/conferences
- Do a Pluralsight Course!

> **The more visible you’re, the more opportunities come your way.**

Remember; Being "expert" in a subject is A LOT of work, and it’s not necessary to help you get paid ANY better, than just staying competent!

### Executing on Your Learning Plan
The common pattern is:

- Start with fundamentals
- Build on them to learn specific information
- Find ways to practice and build skills

**It’s ABSOLUTELY wrong, you should instead:**
- As soon as you grasp the fundamental concepts
- Seek out how you can use it
- Keep practicing

Remember how you started to learn as a kid. You didn’t FULLLY understand the fundamentals, get all information, … etc. It’s much more fun to jump & start doing things than sitting in boring lectures and lose your excitement!

> Skills is what pays the bills, and it’s the fun part. So, it must take A LOT of time from you.

### Conclusion
The one consistent thing is that; I have done Software Development the entire time. I write code, and people pay for it - Consistency is the key here!

> **Time is the real cost of learning.**
